# Intro

I got the basic idea at internship period, at PayamPardaz Co.

I am trying to start implementing my dream about the most secure network based on SDx and AI solutions.



# FrameWork & Material

I gonna use Onos controller as base controller for managing the SDN demands
Also for some basic tests i may use RYU controller and if i can solve the RYU controller
clustering i may use RYU instead Onos.

Also i will create my own manager to work as orchestrator to handle SDN and SDWan devices

The manager gonna be a GUI for communicating to this administration app.

On the controller side i gonna implement an AI core for analysis and traffic engineering and 
intrusion detection and handling. Also the controller is responsible for managing SDN and SDWan demands.


The agent is the SDWan agent which is the Wan Edge. 

This is a big dream but can be possible.
