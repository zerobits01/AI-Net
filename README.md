# Intro

I got the basic idea at internship period, at PayamPardaz Co.

# FrameWork & Material

I gonna use Onos controller as base controller for managing the SDN demands

Also i will create my own manager to work as orchestrator to handle SDN and SDWan devices

The manager will have an AI Core for analysing the traffic and handling some Security Risks

### i wanna use these technologies:
- jenkins
- docker
- ansible
- python
- Django/Flask
- C/Cpp
- gRPC
- REST-API
- WebSocket
- nginx/gunicorn

# TODO:

- implementing the edge server agents using VPP
- implementing a simple topology using Onos and Vpp
- implementing the AI-Core manager for analysing the traffic

maybe the first step for analysing will be the DHCP


# Done:

- learning the basics of SDN
- learning the basics of SDWan and VPP
- implementing a scenario with vpp(high performance layer2 tunneling)
